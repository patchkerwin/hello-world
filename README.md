# hello-world

Hello! 

My name is Patrick Kerwin and I am excited to be in this class! I am originally from Tucson, but have bounced all over the place since graduating high school. 
I went to Colorado College for undergrad, and studied anthropology, focusing on archaeology and dendrochronology.
I worked as an environmental educator and wilderness guide for much of my time in school, teaching students in Colorado and Minnesota, and leading wilderness trips across North America.
Since starting the MS GIST program, I have spent time interning at the AZ Department of Water Resources, NASA's Disasters Program, and with the NASA DEVELOP program working on a project using remote sensing to identify the best places to plant trees in San Jose, CA.
I am currently based in San Francisco, and love to bike, run (especially on trails), cook, and spend as much time outside as possible.
Cheers!
